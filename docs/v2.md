# V2 migration

Changes:

- Context 
    - container first class citizen 
    - default mount point in the container is /workspace/.taskctl
        - if you are referencing an absolute path this should be changed to reflect the new path. 
        - _ALTERNATIVELY_, you should use relative paths, as the `-w /taskctl` is set and you are automatically in the root of your directory

- env and envfile
    - env is now added to Context, Pipelines, and Tasks
        - It is merged in this order Context < Pipelines < Tasks - i.e. Tasks will overwrite anything set previously.
    
    - eirctl.env will be read in at a context level

- Scheduler
    - denormalized graph allowing for a unique path to the same task

## Env

`REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` will point to a file with registry auths in the below format, the name was chosen as it is not directly tied to docker.

```json
{
"auths": {
  "registry.url": {
      "auth": "base64AuthString"
    }
  }
}
```

> The authentication string is usually in the username:password format - the AuthFunc makes this assumption. So far all the Container Registries tested - ECR, ACR, Dockerhub, Gitlab - use this format. When the use case arises for an `identitytoken` it will be dealt with then.
